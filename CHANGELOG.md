## 0.3.0

 - Now **requires Forge 14.23.5.2772** to run due to technical reasons.
 - Add Drink.
   - It is just a specialized dish.
   - Yes, you drink it, not eat it.
   - Being similar to dish, drink also supports arbitrary ingredients and "seasonings".
   - Notice that it is not soup.
 - Some materials can exist in form of "juice" now.
 - Add "Drinkro™"
   - Uh. It makes drinks. That's it.
   - Right click it with valid ingredients to put them in.
   - Highly WIP. Report bugs if you encounter one.
 - Add Basins.
   - Basins are processing devices.
   - They come with two variants: wooden and earthen. Earthen basin are made from clay.
   - Earthen variants may be dyed.
   - May be used for distillation. For example, salt now requires basin to make. See JEI for details.
     - Distillation requires heat source. Sunlight may work if enabled in config. Typical heat source include lava and torches.
     - Old way of making salt are removed.
   - May be used for throwing things into it to get new things. See JEI for details.
   - Has a basic CraftTweaker support.
 - Add Squeezer.
   - It is essentially a miniature vanilla piston.
   - It has animation!
   - You should use it together with basin.
   - Does not exist in item form; you may get it by putting a vanilla piston on top of a basin.
   - Use redstone to control it, just like a vanilla piston.
   - Used for squeezing stuff in basin. See JEI for details.
   - Has a basic CraftTweaker support.
 - Add several fruits that belongs to Citrus genus.
   - Namely: Pomelo, Citron, Mandarin, Grapefruit, Orange, Lemon and Lime.
   - Their plants are trees. So there are corresponding wood logs, saplings and leaves.
   - Of course you can use those wood logs to make chopping boards.
   - However, do notice that those saplings are still WIP, and they cannot grow right now.
   - Saplings and logs are currently unobtainable (unless using JEI or some other sorts).
 - Chopping Board now has a better model.
   - The word "better" here is referring the technical details.
     - Its visual appearance does not change at all.
     - The item form of chopping board is no longer a `TileEntityItemStackRenderer`.
     - The block form of chopping board is no longer using `TileEntitySpecialRenderer` for the board base part and the knife part.
     - The TESR is kept for rendering the item being put on board.
   - May improve both performance and compatibility. According to reports, they work fine with OptiFine now.
   - Many thanks to @tterrag1098, @bs2609, @Shadow-of-Fire and @gigaherz for their help on this one!
 - Bamboo now has a better model.
 - Bamboo may be used as a blowpipe now. This can be disabled in config.
 - Add a vast catalog of inter-mod compatibilities.
   - You may use JEI to look up all three types of basin processing recipes.
   - You may use CraftTweaker to add more basin processing recipes. Recipe removal will be here soon™.
   - Add HWYLA support. Modelled after the existed TheOneProbe support.
   - Add Farming for Blockheads support. You may get Cuisine's bamboo shoots from that.
   - Add ToughAsNail support. Drinks may restore thirst value if TAN is present.
   - Certain raw food and liquids from the following are now valid ingredients or seasonings in Cuisine:
     - Biomes O' Plenty
     - Pam's HarvestCraft
     - PizzaCraft
     - Rustic
     - Vanilla Food Pantry
 - Address [GH-12](https://github.com/Snownee/Cuisine/issues/12): there is now a config option to not giving new player a Culinary Manual.
 - Fix [GH-15](https://github.com/Snownee/Cuisine/issues/15): crash on dedicated server due to accidentally referring client-only class.
 - API overhaul.
   - There are now methods to allow other mods to map their items to certain Cuisine ingredients.
   - `isKnownMaterial` -> `isKnownIngredient`
   - Introduce `CompositeFood.Builder`. It represents a "WIP" dish.
   - `CompositeFood` is now fully abstract. You may extend this to have a brand new type of compound food.
     - As an example, the new drink system is built on this.
   - `IngredientCharacteristics` -> `IngredientTrait`
   - New enum: `Taste`. Has 5 values: `SOUR`, `SWEET`, `BITTER`, `SALTY` and `SAVOR`. Not used so far.
   - `CookingStrategy` gets overhauled.
   - Many other breaking changes - after all, we are still on `0.x.x` stage. Everything is in flux.
 - Fix many bugs. We don't even remember what they are, or those bugs only ever existed in dev environment.
   - May introduce more bugs. You have been warned.
 - Many internal code cleanup. Under 90% circumstances they do NOT improve performance; they are mainly for code style and easier development.
